# Identified Issues in Current Implementation

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several key issues that need to be addressed:

## 1. Text Data Usage Issues

- **Placeholder Usage**: The current implementation uses utterance IDs as placeholders instead of actual text data from the IEMOCAP dataset. In `vad_conversion/text_to_vad.py`, we see:
  ```python
  # Since we don't have the actual text transcriptions, we'll use a pre-trained model approach
  # We'll use the utterance IDs as placeholders for now
  texts = vad_df['utterance_id'].tolist()
  ```

- **No Text Processing**: Despite claiming to use text modality, there's no actual text processing happening. The model architecture is set up for text input, but it's not being used with real text data.

## 2. VAD Conversion Issues

- **No Actual Training**: The text-to-VAD model is defined but not actually trained:
  ```python
  # In a real scenario with actual text data, you would train the model like this:
  # history = model.train(texts, vad_df, epochs=5, batch_size=16)
  # plot_training_history(history)
  
  # For now, we'll just save the untrained model
  model.save_model(output_dir)
  ```

- **Missing Implementation**: The actual conversion from text to VAD values is not implemented, making the entire pipeline non-functional for real text data.

## 3. Emotion Mapping Issues

- **Deterministic Rule-Based Mapping**: Emotions are derived directly from VAD values using hard-coded thresholds in functions like `quadrant_mapping`, `custom_mapping`, `plutchik_mapping`, and `ekman_mapping` in `emotion_classification/vad_to_emotion_research.py`. For example:
  ```python
  def assign_emotion_plutchik(row):
      v, a, d = row['valence_norm'], row['activation_norm'], row['dominance_norm']
      
      if v >= 0.7 and a >= 0.7:
          return 'joy'
      elif v >= 0.7 and a < 0.3:
          return 'trust'
      # ... more rules
  ```
  This makes the classification task trivial and deterministic rather than learned.

## 4. Evaluation Issues

- **No Train-Test Split**: The evaluation in `evaluation/model_evaluation.py` is performed on the entire dataset rather than a proper test set:
  ```python
  # Make predictions on the entire dataset
  predictions = classifier.predict(X)
  
  # Calculate accuracy
  accuracy = accuracy_score(y, predictions['predicted_emotion'])
  ```

- **Data Leakage**: The same data is used for both training the VAD-to-emotion classifier and evaluating it, leading to artificially high accuracy scores.

- **Cross-Validation Issues**: While there is cross-validation code, it's applied after the deterministic mapping has already been done, which doesn't address the fundamental issue.

## 5. Dataset Handling Issues

- **Missing IEMOCAP Integration**: There's no code to properly extract and process the actual IEMOCAP dataset, which should include text transcriptions.

- **Missing Data Preprocessing**: Proper text preprocessing steps (tokenization, cleaning, etc.) are missing.

## 6. Implementation Approach Issues

- **Two-Step Process Not Properly Implemented**: While the code structure suggests a two-step approach (text â†’ VAD â†’ emotion), the first step is not actually implemented with real data.

- **Missing Model Evaluation**: There's no proper evaluation of the text-to-VAD conversion step.

## Next Steps

To address these issues, we need to:

1. Set up proper access to the IEMOCAP dataset
2. Extract actual text data from the dataset
3. Implement a proper text-to-VAD conversion using NLP techniques
4. Revise the VAD-to-emotion mapping to use learned models instead of deterministic rules
5. Implement proper train-test splits and evaluation methodology
6. Run experiments with the improved implementation
7. Document the changes and results
